# Motivation

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.I want to use a dateset from Airbnb to help people make decision when traveling to Seattle.

# What's included

airbnb.ipynb  - include all the code used to solve the problem

Blog Post.md  - a blog post summary the result of the project

# Summary

Through my analysis, i found that summer is the busiest season. If you want to travel in a more leisure way, you'd better not go to Seattle in summer.

By building a model to predict the price of house,i found that neighbourhood is the most important factor affecting housing prices. Magnolia, Queen Anne and Downtown is the most expensive area. So if you want to reduce your travel budget, you should avoid to order a house in these places.

I also write a blog post to show the result.
