# Motivation

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way.I want to use a dateset from Airbnb to help people make decision when traveling to Seattle.

# Part I： When is the busiest time of the year in Seattle?

When we want to travel to a city, the first question come to our mind is when to travel.

I counted the monthly bookings for Seattle,and find that Seattle is very busy in summer. If you want to travel in a more leisure way, you'd better not go to Seattle in summer

# Part II: What factors are house prices related to?

Travel budget is an important part of travel planning.So i want to know what factors are house prices related to? 

By building a model to predict the house price, I find the most important factor is room type and neighbor.If you wan to reduce your travel budget, you'd better find a house in a cheap neighborhood and share with others.









# Part III：Where can we find cheap house？

I group the house by neighbor,and find Magnolia, Queen Anne and Downtown is the most expensive area. So if you want to reduce your travel budget, you should avoid to order a house in these places.
